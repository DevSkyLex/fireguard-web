# Facilities Feature

## Purpose

Owns organization-scoped facility workflows.

This subfeature is responsible for:

- listing facilities for the active organization,
- facility creation,
- active facility context for detail and edit flows,
- facility detail and edit route orchestration.

This subfeature does not own top-level organization selection. That remains in `features/organization`.

## Entry Points

- Routes: `facilities.routes.ts`
- Public API: `index.ts`

## Routes

- `/organizations/:organizationId/facilities`
- `/organizations/:organizationId/facilities/create`
- `/organizations/:organizationId/facilities/:facilityId`
- `/organizations/:organizationId/facilities/:facilityId/edit`

Facility detail routes resolve facility context before child pages render.

## State and Data Access

Primary stores:

- `FacilityStore`
- `ActiveFacilityStore`

Primary service:

- `FacilityService`

## Cross-Feature Dependencies

- Depends on organization route context from the parent organization feature.
- May compose with sibling organization subfeatures in pages when the workflow requires it, but must not take ownership of their state.

## Invariants

- Facility routes remain organization-scoped.
- Active facility state belongs to this subfeature.
- Facility resolvers and facility page orchestration belong here, not in the parent feature or layouts.
