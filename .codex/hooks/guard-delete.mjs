/**
 * Native Codex PreToolUse guard — block irreversible or history-rewriting shell
 * commands before they run. Deny = exit 2 with a message on stderr; everything else
 * = exit 0.
 *
 * The companion to guard.mjs: that one guards what gets *written*, this one guards
 * what gets *destroyed*. It reads `tool_input.command` from Bash and PowerShell calls.
 *
 * Denies:
 *  1. RECURSIVE deletion of an ABSOLUTE, drive-rooted, `~`-rooted or
 *     `..`-escaping path that is not clearly disposable. Relative targets inside
 *     the working tree pass: they live under git, so a wrong delete is one
 *     `git checkout -- <path>` away from recovery. `git rm` (recursive or not)
 *     always passes for the same reason — it stages the deletion for review.
 *  2. `git clean` with -f/-d/-x, which silently discards untracked work.
 *  3. `git reset --hard`, `git checkout/restore .`, and `git push --force` on a
 *     shared branch — history and uncommitted work are not the assistant's to drop.
 *  4. Destructive SQL (DROP DATABASE/TABLE, TRUNCATE) and `doctrine:schema:drop`.
 *  5. `rm` of a whole app tree, `.git/`, or the monorepo root itself.
 *
 * Loosened 2026-08-20 on the user's explicit instruction: `git branch -D` passes
 * (the reflog keeps the commits ~90 days, and squash-merged branches trip the -d
 * safety uselessly), `git rm` passes, and in-tree relative recursive deletes pass.
 * The guard's job is the blast radius git cannot undo, not deletion in general.
 *
 * Loosened again 2026-08-25, same instruction, after rule 1 denied
 * `rm -f <relative>.bak`. Two false positives, both in rule 1, neither of which
 * ever reduced the blast radius:
 *   - `-f` counted as recursive. It is not: `rm -f` takes named files only.
 *     Now `-r` is required.
 *   - The delete verb and the out-of-tree target were matched against the whole
 *     command line rather than one segment. Every compound command opens with
 *     `cd "G:/Projets/…"`, so that `cd` satisfied "absolute path" for any `rm`
 *     after the `&&`. Rule 1 now runs per shell segment.
 * Rules 2-5 are unchanged: `git reset --hard` and `git checkout .` in particular
 * stay denied, because they would erase uncommitted work in progress.
